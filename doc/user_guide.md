#Installing the extension on chrome like browsers

## How to install on "Iridium"
1) Download  the extension folder to the desktop.
2) Go to the browser's extension page (simply  type "chrome:extensions" in the address bar or use the menus). 
3) Enable "Developer mode". 
4) Click  "Load unpacked".
5) Select the extension folder on the desktop and press enter.

The  extension appears in the browser's extension page and displays two buttons. It is already able to run but requires special permissions  to work  in private mode or with a local file. To give those permissions,  click  "Details" and and check the proper checkboxes.

To manage the extension click the extension icon, which looks like a piece of jigsaw puzzle in the tool bar. 

To add stress marks to a local file, drag and drop it onto any browser page. If the local file (html or simple text) is encoded in Windows-1251,  the browser converts it to utf-8.

The extension was also tested on "Vivaldi" (a fork of "Opera"). The installation
on  "Vivaldi" is similar but the management of the extension is somewhat different.
